## Installation

You will need `git` and GNU `stow`

Clone into your `$HOME` directory or `~`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoahHakansson/Flexfiles.git ~
```

Run `stow` to symlink everything or just select what you want

```bash
stow */ # Everything (the '/' ignores the README)
```

```bash
stow zsh # Just my zsh config
```

## Wayland fixes
### brave-browser (should work on chromium based browsers)
go to `brave://flags/` search for ozone and change the setting to `auto`.
Close and relaunch the app fully (not the relaunch button). Should be fine after that.
