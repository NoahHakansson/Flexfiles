## Install

You will need `git` and GNU `stow`

Clone into your `$HOME` directory or `~`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoahHakansson/Flexfiles.git ~
```

Run `stow` to symlink everything or just select what you want

```bash
stow */ # Everything (the '/' ignores the README)
```

```bash
stow zsh # Just my zsh config
```

## Requirements
* Tmux Needs TPM for plugins [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
* lvim (LunarVim) Make sure you have installed the latest version of Neovim v0.7.0+. Have git, make, pip, npm, node and cargo installed on your system.

## Programs (TODO)

An updated list of all the programs I use can be found in the `programs` directory
